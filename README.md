# Data-Mining-Student-Performance
Data mining using R on Student Performance dataset. 

Factor analysis of mixed data, random forest regression and classification are the data mining techniques used in the study conducted on the student performance dataset. From factor analysis of mixed data we have derived travel time is negatively correlated with dimension 1, while grade variables are identical to dimension 1. Failure is positively correlated with dimension 2. Grade variables and failures are not identical to failures. A random forest regression model was built to predict the grade variable G3 with 10 mtry and evaluated test data had an error rate of 2.25%. In the random forest classification model built using train data, error dropped at around 50 trees and was constant till last, whereas in the model built using test data, error dropped at round 350 trees. The model was built using 10 mtry because of the low error rate. The variables of importance were Grade variables, failures, absences, higher.
